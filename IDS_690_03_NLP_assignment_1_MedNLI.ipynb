You can intuitively understand the dimensionality of your representation space as \"how much freedom you are allowing the network to have when learning internal representations\". Having more hidden units (a higher-dimensional representation space) allows your network to learn more complex representations, but it makes your network more computationally expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns (patterns that will improve performance on the training data but not on the test data).\n",

For the time being, you will have to trust us with the following architecture choice: two intermediate layers with 16 hidden units each, and a third layer which will output the scalar prediction regarding the sentiment of the current review. The intermediate layers will use relu as their \"activation function\", and the final layer will use a sigmoid activation so as to output a probability (a score between 0 and 1, indicating how likely the sample is to have the target \"1\", i.e. how likely the review is to be positive). A relu (rectified linear unit) is a function meant to zero-out negative values, while a sigmoid \"squashes\" arbitrary values into the [0, 1] interval, thus outputting something that can be interpreted as a probability."

But that isn't the case for the validation loss and accuracy: they seem to peak at the fourth epoch. This is an example of what we were warning against earlier: a model that performs better on the training data isn't necessarily a model that will do better on data it has never seen before. In precise terms, what you are seeing is \"overfitting\": after the second epoch, we are over-optimizing on the training data, and we ended up learning representations that are specific to the training data and do not generalize to data outside of the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, to prevent overfitting, we could simply stop training after three epochs. In general, there is a range of techniques you can leverage to mitigate overfitting, which we will cover in the next chapter.\n",

        "Stacks of Dense layers with relu activations can solve a wide range of problems (including sentiment classification), and you will likely use them frequently.\n",
        "In a binary classification problem (two output classes), your network should end with a Dense layer with 1 unit and a sigmoid activation, i.e. the output of your network should be a scalar between 0 and 1, encoding a probability.\n",
        "With such a scalar sigmoid output, on a binary classification problem, the loss function you should use is binary_crossentropy.\n",
        "The rmsprop optimizer is generally a good enough choice of optimizer, whatever your problem. That's one less thing for you to worry about.\n",
        "As they get better on their training data, neural networks eventually start overfitting and end up obtaining increasingly worse results on data never-seen-before. Make sure to always monitor performance on data that is outside of the training set.\n"
